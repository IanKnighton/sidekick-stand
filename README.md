# Sidekick Stand

An Autodesk Fusion 360 project to create a keyboard stand for my [Cortex Brand Sidekick Notepad](https://cottonbureau.com/p/XT9MRF/journal/sidekick-notepad#/16404980/black-paper-12x7). 

## The Intent

I love the Sidekick Notepad. I love the way that it lays out. 

However, I had some issues:

1. When I have it below my keyboard, my keyboard is too flat sometimes.
2. I spend a lot of time either reviewing film for the soccer team I coach or on zoom meetings for my day job. That means I spend a lot of time just needing access to the spacebar and arrow keys.
3. The gap between my keyboard and monitor stand is _barely_ enough for the keyboard and notepad together.

I started playing around with the idea that maybe adding a slope to the keyboard would help with those issues. Not necessarily for long typing sessions (_I move the notepad when I'm doing that anyways_), but great in a lot of other scenarios. 

## Design Goals

* Be able to print on an Ender 3 v2 or similar printer. 
* Use as little filament as possible.
* Hold my Keychron K8 stably so it can be used for typing. 
* Simple enough that anyone could just grab the `.stl` and go to town with it. 

## Printing

The support piece that goes under the notepad is only 1mm thick, so you'll want to make sure your tramming (bed leveling) is good and you have a good build plate. 

Outside of that, the whole intent was to make it so anyone could just print it. If you have a "0.20 mm" layer height setting in your slicer, the defaults will be more than sufficient.
